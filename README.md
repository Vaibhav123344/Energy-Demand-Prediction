Title: Explainable AI (XAI) for Delhi's Peak Power Demand Forecasting

Description: This project moves beyond simple prediction by using a high-performance XGBoost model paired with SHAP (Explainable AI). It not only forecasts peak power demand but also quantifies the precise impact of over 30 meteorological drivers, identifying why demand changes. The core application is an XAI-powered dashboard that enables "what-if" scenario analysis, allowing planners to see the real-time demand impact of specific weather changes.
